      <h2 class="page-section__title">Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
      <div class="page-section__content">
        <p>
          Privacy isn't just a feature for us, it's our core principle. Every decision we make prioritizes your anonymity
          and data security. We don't sell your data, and we don't require any personal
          information to use our service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our temporary email service operates on a simple philosophy: you should be able to protect your privacy
          without jumping through hoops. That's why we've built a system that works instantly, requires zero
          registration, and automatically deletes all data after the specified time period.

    <!-- How We're Different -->

      <h2 class="page-section__title">How We Stand Out</h2>
      <div class="page-section__content">
        <p>
          While many temporary email services exist, we've focused on creating an experience that actually respects your
          time and privacy. Our service offers multiple inbox durations (10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and 7
          days), giving you flexibility based on your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've also eliminated the annoying elements common in other services: no captchas, no intrusive ads, no forced
          delays. When you need a temporary email, you get one instantly. When you need to check your inbox, it loads
          immediately. Simple as that.

      <div class="page-section__content">
        <p>
          Our infrastructure is designed to handle millions of temporary emails while maintaining fast delivery times.
          We use modern web technologies to ensure emails arrive in your inbox within seconds, and our lightweight
          interface works smoothly on any device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Security is built into every layer. All connections use HTTPS encryption, emails are stored securely during
          their limited lifespan, and everything is automatically purged according to our retention policies. We don't
          keep logs of your activity or create profiles of our users.
